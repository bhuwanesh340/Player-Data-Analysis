# Player-Data-Analysis

The object of the project was to analyze the data of football players and find out the best way to predict their injuries.

Football players are very prone to injuries due to hectic seasons and obviously the nature of game makes it difficult to keep up.

I have made an attempt here to analyze the data and present few insights along with a simple neural networks model to predict recovery time from the injury as well as the number of injuries a player can have.

Please feel free to check out and share your thoughts.
